# Benjy
Benjy is our 2012 robot who  competed in the North Carolina regional, won the South Carolina regional with the help of or alliance partners, and went to championships in St. Louis at the end of April 2012.
Benjy shoots using two spinning wheels which use their own motors and gear boxes. Using our rotation-based input system, Benjy can take field elements from the floor and feed them up to the shooter.
One of Benjy’s strongest traits was its ability to collaborate with other teams at the end game, balancing upon small, teetering bridges.
